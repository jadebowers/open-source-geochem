Motivation:
As a graduate student, I have come across a number of basic geochemistry plots that most of us need on hand, but no easy way to create these in R. I spent many hours teaching myself R syntax and functions to recreate these plots with ease throughout my project. If I went through all this trouble, why not help others out? So, I have decided to create a repository that includes the codes and reports that explain how to use them. As I create these documents, they will be indexed here in the README.txt. Also, if you have your own plots that you would like to share or recommendations to existing ones, do not hesitate to reach out!
